SSL certificate has been created with DNS verification for devopschallenge.postfix.in with cname "removed"
Its still in pending verification state, once it is validated, I only have to provide "devopschallenge.postfix.in" in alternate domain name in Cloudfront and everything will start propogating with "devopschallenge.postfix.in"

For now I have used the below domain for the assignment using my own domain, created SSL certificate with Email verification, below urls are up and running and will be Up till 3rd sept 2020.
